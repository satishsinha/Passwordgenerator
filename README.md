#Password Generator

This Python script allows users to generate passwords of varying complexities based on their preferences. It provides two options: an "easy" password, which is a simple concatenation of random characters, and a "hard" password, which incorporates shuffling for increased randomness and security.
Features

    Easy Password Generation: Creates a password by appending random characters without shuffling.
    Hard Password Generation: Generates a password by shuffling randomly selected characters for enhanced security.
    User Input: Allows users to specify the length of the password, the number of symbols, and the number of digits desired.
    Output: Prints both "easy" and "hard" passwords for user selection.

How to Use

    Run the Python script.
